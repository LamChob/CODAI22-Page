## Overview
The goal of the **CODAI'23** workshop is to bring together the emerging energy in the AI compiler communities and AI accelerator communities focusing on Edge AI in both academic and industrial research. These realms of research have the opportunity to deliver a pervasive and seamless end-to-end tooling that connects hardware and software development methodologies. This workshop mainly focuses on:

- Discussing new impulses for deployment of neural networks on edge devices
- Cooperative development of (open source) toolchains/frameworks for neural network deployment + cooperation between industry and academia

Therefore, it **complements the established conferences CASES and CODES+ISSS** which have a wider and more academic research-spectrum.
We also welcome work-in-progress papers of ongoing research projects and case studies from industrial applications.
Topics for workshop submissions include, but are not limited to:

- Compilers for Edge AI: partitioning, µC, heterogeneous systems,  intermediate representations or (domain specific) languages
- Optimization techniques and performance estimation of neural networks on edge device: e.g., compression, quantization techniques, virtual prototyping
- Code-generation and hardware-backends for Embedded AI accelerators - especially for RISC-V is appreciated
- Applications: processing of embedded vision, time-series data, etc.
- Novel brain-inspired algorithm for Edge AI
- Compiler and optimization techniques for beyond-von-Neumann AI accelerators

## How to Find Us

On-Site: The workshop will be held in Building H, Ground Floor, Room H0.07 of the ESWeek Conference Venue. More Infomation [here](https://esweek.org/venue-floorplan/)

Online: [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87309580132)

## Review
CODAI 2022 was a great success with many contributions from academia, industry, and international tech leaders. We accepted five high-quality papers and were positively surprised by the quality and extensiveness of submitted papers (one paper even open sourced their code on GitHub after the notification of acceptance).
